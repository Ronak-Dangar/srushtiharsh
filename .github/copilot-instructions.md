## Project Overview
This is a romantic surprise Next.js web application built with:

## Design Guidelines

- Ensure touch-friendly interactions (minimum 48x48px buttons)

## Code Conventions
- Use functional React components with hooks
- Implement accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Follow Tailwind CSS utility-first approach
- Use Framer Motion for all animations and transitions
